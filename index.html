<!--- I admit I just copied this head. I typed it out on my own but I copied it letter for letter from another project. 
I will definitely get used to what to type after drilling it several times.
But I just wanted to admit I was reading along with another project's head, in case you all think that's cheating.
Hopefully not. ---->

<!---- Overall, I can't believe how much I learned about web design in just a few lessons. 
I know it's just the tip of the iceberg, but you all did such a fantastic job laying out the information.
I cannot wait to do more in-depth work. Thanks for everything so far Thinkful folks!!!---->
